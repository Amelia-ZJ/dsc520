Background: We will be fitting a Logistic Regression Model using the Thoracic Surgery Binary Dataset from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. The data set contains information on the life expectancy of lung cancer patients after Thoracic surgery.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(ppcor)
library(purrr)
library(foreign)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, root.dir = "C:/Users/Amelia/Documents/Bellevue/dsc520/completed/Exercise 10.2")
thoracicdata <- read.arff("ThoraricSurgery.arff")
```

## Peak at the data
Lets start by looking at the data headers and first 3 lines to get a peak at the variable we will be working with.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(thoracicdata,3)
```

## Binary logistic regression model 
Next we can jump right into it and try fitting a Binary logistic regression model to predict the survival of a patient after one year from the sugary. Our predictor variable is named "Risk1Y" and consists of T or F, meaning the patent T=Survived or F=Did not survive.We will be making this prediction based off
```{r, echo=TRUE, results = "hide"}
names(thoracicdata)
```



```{r, echo=TRUE, results = "hide"}
names(thoracicdata)
```
